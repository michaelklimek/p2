##Live URL:

##Description of Project 2:
Project 2 involved creating a xkcd Password Generator using Arrays and Loops. The generator randomly creates a password based on the number of words selected, adding numbers, and/or adding symbols. A brief description is on the top of the page and the comic image is at the bottom. This was added to give to a better understanding to anyone who is not familiar with the xkcd password generator.

##Demo Information:
I will be doing the demo for this project in my section on Wednesday, October 8th, 2014 at 7:30pm EST.

##Details for instrutor/TAs:
